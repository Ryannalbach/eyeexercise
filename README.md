This is an exercise from MIT and the license is through MIT for the code
This code runs by loading the html file and moving your cursor on the screen
the eyes will follow the cursor and that is the basics of this exercise.
for future improvements I would like to create svg embedded elements that are
actual eyes that follow the cursor.
